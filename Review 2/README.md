Urban flooding in underpasses poses significant risks to public safety, traffic flow, and infrastructure in Bengaluru. This project presents an IoT-based solution for real-time flood monitoring, automated drainage, and intelligent traffic management to mitigate these challenges effectively.

The system utilizes wireless sensor networks, weather forecasting models, and water level sensors to detect rainfall patterns and predict flood risks in underpasses. An LCD showcases real-time moisture and humidity readings, along with system status updates such as "Water Detected" or "System Normal." 

A microcontroller-based automation system processes real-time data and autonomously activates drainage pumps when water levels exceed predefined thresholds, ensuring efficient water redirection. a backup motor is automatically triggered to ensure efficient water drainage. Additionally, the system incorporates LED indicators, a buzzer alarm, and real-time data display on an LCD screen to alert authorities. Future enhancements will include automated message notifications and advanced sensor integration to improve flood management efficiency!
