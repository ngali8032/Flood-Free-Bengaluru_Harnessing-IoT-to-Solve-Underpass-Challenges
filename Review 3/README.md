<H3>Result</H3>

Our project provides real-time monitoring of water levels, temperature, and humidity in urban underpasses and low-lying areas.

We have included an automated drainage system that activates pumps to remove excess water when water levels exceed predefined thresholds.

A user-friendly web server allows the public to access real-time flood data from any device with internet connectivity.

Our Project is designed to be low-cost and easy to maintain, making it suitable for widespread deployment in urban and rural areas.
